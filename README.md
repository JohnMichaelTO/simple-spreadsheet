## Running the tests

In order to run the unit tests, run the following command in the project directory:
```
npm test
```

### Unit/Integration tests

As part of the testing, as described below (cf. [Design consideration part](#Design-consideration)), some unit tests are implemented in order to check each action related to the spreadsheet features.

#### InputCommand component
* **Creating a spreadsheet command**: checks if the regular expression works accordingly and performs a group matching with the action to create with a specific width and height
* **Inserting a number command**: checks if the regular expression works accordingly and performs a group matching with the action to insert with a specific cell represented by (x, y)
* **Summing command**: checks if the regular expression works accordingly and performs a group matching with the action to perform a sum from coordinates (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) into (x3, y3)
* **Quitting command**: checks if the regular expression works accordingly and performs a group matching with the action to quit

#### Spreadsheet component
* **Creating a spreadsheet**: checks the possibility to create a spreadsheet with a specific width and height
* **isCoordinatesInBoundaries(x, y)**: checks if the coordinate (x, y) is within the boundaries of the spreadsheet
* **Inserting a number**: checks the possibility to insert a number into a specific cell (x, y) after creating successfully a spreadsheet, it also checks if the value is correctly inserted into the spreadsheet
* **Summing**: combines multiple insertions and verify that the sum is correctly inserted into the specified cell
* **Quitting**: checks if the spreadsheet is correctly cleared as well as data
* **formatNumberDisplay()**: checks if a number is correctly formatted to follow the specification of 3 characters per cell with right justification
* **show()**: checks if the spreadsheet is correctly rendered to the end-user

## Deployment

In order to deploy the application, use the following command to create a production build:
```
npm run build
```

Use the build folder to deploy the application in any web server.

## Design consideration

This React application was built with an **InputCommand** component in order to handle any command entered by an end-user.

Associated with that, the component **Spreadsheet** handles the spreadsheet itself with different actions such as **create**, **insert**, **sum**, **quit**.

Finally, the **App** component makes the use of both previous components to put them together as a single application.

### InputCommand component
The **InputCommand** component is in charge of handling the text entered by an end-user in the text field `Command`. It translates the text into a request sent to the **App** component using regular expressions. Those requests match with the **Spreadsheet** component's actions: create, insert, sum, quit.

### Spreadsheet component
The **Spreadsheet** component is in charge of handling a request given from the **App** component. It translates the request into an action in order to:
* create a new spreadsheet
* insert a number in a cell
* sum up values into a specific cell
* quit the spreadsheet

The data is also handled by this component as well as showing the spreadsheet to the end-user.

### ErrorNotification component
The **ErrorNotification** component is used for displaying an error message alert. It can be used by any component by passing a message as property.

### CommandsTable component
The **CommandsTable** component displays the available commands with a description for each of them into a table.

### App component
The **App** component is the result of all the components and especially **InputCommand** and **Spreadsheet** components. It's in charge of passing the request from one to another component and acts as an intermediary.

## Limitations
The current limitations are the following:
* One cell is represented by 3 characters
* A sum can not be performed when the result is above 999
* Only numbers between 0 and 999 are allowed

## Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - The web framework used
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) - Dependency Management
